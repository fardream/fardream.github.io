## About Mechanically Systematic

Long time ago I was talking with a colleague about a trading system, and I mentioned "this is a very mechanical process". The colleague quickly commented "hey, that's not very good". For somebody who is from an academic background in Mechanical Engineering, that comment slightly hurt my feelings - of course, I know my colleague bear no ill will. In my limited understanding, "mechanic" and "systematic" are similar, but I did realize people may associate "mechanical" with "lower effort" or "unsophisticated".

Fast forward several years. After doodling at home for almost a year, I feel that maybe I should write something - partly to make myself intellectually entertained, partly to remind myself some of the knowledges that I have gathered. Of course, those knowledge are no more than what is taught in a standard textbook, but I am just settling for taking pleasure in verifying $$1+1=2$$.

So I decided to start this "Mechanically Systematic" - it's very textbook-y (or "mechanical") but covers systematic trading (in big word). I will first cover portfolio optimization, then move on to some technical topics regarding `C++` and others - those will be accompanied by proper repos to share the code.
